Introduction
This project provides a Python-based tool to process student grade data from various file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel). It calculates summary statistics for each subject and presents insights such as:

Average grade
Highest and lowest grades
Number of passing students (grade ≥ 60)
This tool is designed for educators and administrators seeking an efficient way to analyze grade data across multiple subjects.

Features
File Format Support: Load grade data from CSV, JSON, and Excel files.
Statistical Analysis:
Average grade per subject
Highest and lowest grades per subject
Number of passing students per subject
Error Handling:
Handles invalid files and data gracefully.
Ensures robust parsing for diverse datasets.
Extensibility: Easily customizable to add new features like data visualization.
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd student-grade-processor
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Add Your Data Files
Place your input files (e.g., grades.csv, grades.json, or grades.xlsx) in the data/ folder.

Usage
Running the Tool
The tool can be executed via the command line:

bash
Copy code
python src/task1/grade_analyzer.py --file data/grades.csv
Supported File Types
CSV: Automatically parsed using Pandas.
JSON: Loaded using Python's json module.
Excel: Handled via Pandas.
Sample Output
For a file data/grades.csv:

plaintext
Copy code
Subject: Math
    Average Grade: 88.5
    Highest Grade: 92
    Lowest Grade: 85
    Passing Students: 2

Subject: Physics
    Average Grade: 83.0
    Highest Grade: 88
    Lowest Grade: 78
    Passing Students: 2

Design Decisions
Pandas for Data Handling: Chosen for its powerful and intuitive data manipulation capabilities, especially for CSV and Excel files.
json for JSON Parsing: The standard json module is lightweight and sufficient for handling JSON files.
Modular Design: The code is split into functions and modules for readability, reusability, and ease of testing.
Error Handling: Files are validated before processing, and invalid entries are skipped with warnings.
Known Limitations
Data Formats: Only supports CSV, JSON, and Excel at this stage. Unsupported file types will raise an error.
Large Files: Performance may degrade for files with millions of rows. Optimization for large datasets is planned.
Sorting: While sorting of results by subject or average grade is planned, it’s not yet implemented.
Future Enhancements
Add data visualization with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Support for additional file formats (e.g., XML).
Implement an interactive CLI for selecting options.
Integrate sorting options for results.
